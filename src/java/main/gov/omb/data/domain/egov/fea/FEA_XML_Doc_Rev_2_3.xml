        <MeasurementAreaDefinitionText>The Technology Measurement Area captures key elements of performance directly relating to the IT initiative. An IT initiative can include applications, infrastructure, or services provided in support of a process or program. While these IT-specific aspects of performance (e.g. percent system availability) are important, they alone do not truly assess the value of an IT initiative to overall performance. The Technology Measurement Area attains far more relevance only when used with other Measurement Areas to get a full and accurate picture of overall performance.</MeasurementAreaDefinitionText>
